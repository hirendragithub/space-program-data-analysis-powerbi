# 🚀 Space Program Data Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes global space missions from 1957 to 2022, including missions conducted by NASA, SpaceX, US Air Force, RVSN USSR, and other major space organizations.

The dashboard provides interactive insights into:

- Total missions launched
- Success vs Failure rates
- Total budget spent by organization
- Budget spent per mission
- Launch trends over time
- Rocket status (Active vs Retired)

This project demonstrates data cleaning, transformation, modeling, KPI creation, and data storytelling using Power BI.
