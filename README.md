🚀 Space Program Data Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of global space missions from 1957 to 2022.
The dataset includes missions conducted by major space organizations such as NASA, SpaceX, US Air Force, RVSN USSR, and other international space agencies.

The Power BI dashboard provides insights into:

Total missions launched

Success vs Failure rates

Total budget spent by organization

Budget spent per mission

Historical launch trends

Rocket status (Active vs Retired)

Mission outcome distribution

This project demonstrates data cleaning, transformation, modeling, and business insight generation using Power BI.

🛰 Dataset Description
